"API Knowledge:
io.Reader in Go is an interface used to read bytes from a source.
io.ReaderAt in Go is an interface that allows reading from a specific offset in a source.
The io.Reader interface reads bytes into a byte slice and returns the number of bytes read and any error encountered.
The io.ReaderAt interface reads bytes starting at a given offset into a byte slice and returns the number of bytes read and any error encountered.
Claim: Based on the API Knowledge above, io.Reader and io.ReaderAt have similar usage but different behaviors.",Answer: Correct

"API Knowledge:
sync.Mutex.Lock is used to acquire a lock for the current goroutine.
sync.RWMutex.RLock is used to acquire a read lock for the current goroutine, allowing multiple readers.
The sync.Mutex struct's Lock method locks the mutex. If the lock is already in use, the calling goroutine blocks until the mutex is available.
The sync.RWMutex struct's RLock method locks the mutex for reading. It can be held by an arbitrary number of readers simultaneously, but if a writer is waiting for the lock, no new readers will be allowed to lock the mutex.
Claim: Based on the API Knowledge above, sync.Mutex.Lock and sync.RWMutex.RLock have similar usage but different behaviors.",Answer: Correct
