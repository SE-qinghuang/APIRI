Q: What are the characteristics of http.Get?,"A: http.Get sends an HTTP GET request to the specified URL and returns the server's response, including status, headers, and body. Useful for retrieving data without needing to send data to the server. Synchronous operation, blocking until the response is received."
Q: What are the characteristics of io.Reader?,"A: io.Reader is a fundamental interface for reading data from various sources, like files, network connections, or buffers. Defines a single Read(p []byte) method, filling the provided byte slice with data and returning the number of bytes read. Designed for flexibility and can be implemented by any type that provides data reading functionality."
Q: What are the characteristics of http.Post?,"A: http.Post makes an HTTP POST request to the specified URL, sending data (such as form values or JSON) to the server. Returns the server's response, useful for operations that change state on the server (e.g., submitting forms, uploading files). Like http.Get, it operates synchronously and blocks until the response is available."
Q: What are the characteristics of bufio.NewScanner?,"A: bufio.NewScanner creates a new scanner to tokenize the input from an io.Reader, typically used for reading lines of text or other delimited input. Simplifies processing of text streams by providing convenient methods to read and scan through text. Offers customizable tokenization, allowing developers to define how the input should be split into tokens."
