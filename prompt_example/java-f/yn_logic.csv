"API Knowledge:
java.io.OutputStream.write() is used to write bytes to the output stream.
java.io.OutputStream.close() is used to close the output stream, releasing any system resources associated with this stream.
Before using java.io.OutputStream.write(): ensure that the output stream is open and ready to accept output data. After using java.io.OutputStream.write(): consider flushing the stream if you want to immediately make sure that the written data is sent for processing.
Before using java.io.OutputStream.close(): make sure that all data has been written to the output stream. After using java.io.OutputStream.close(): ensure that you do not attempt to write more data to the stream as it has been closed and any such attempt will result in an IOException.
Q: Based on the API knowledge above, is there a logical order when using java.io.OutputStream.write() and java.io.OutputStream.close()?",A: Yes
"API Knowledge:
java.util.Iterator.next() is used to return the next element in the iteration.
java.util.HashMap.put() is a method used to associate a specific value with a specific key in the map.
Before using java.util.Iterator.next(): ensure that there is a next element in the iteration (using hasNext() method). After using java.util.Iterator.next(): proceed with processing the retrieved element.
Before using java.util.HashMap.put(): decide on the key-value pair you want to store in the map. After using java.util.HashMap.put(): check the return value to see if there was a previous value associated with the key.
Q: Based on the API knowledge above, is there a logical order when using java.util.Iterator.next() and java.util.HashMap.put()?",A: No
"API Knowledge:
java.util.zip.ZipOutputStream.putNextEntry() is used to start writing a new ZIP file entry and positions the stream to the start of the entry data.
java.util.zip.ZipOutputStream.write() is used to write data to the current ZIP file entry.
Before using java.util.zip.ZipOutputStream.putNextEntry(): ensure that any previous entry has been closed and that the ZipOutputStream is ready for a new entry. After using java.util.zip.ZipOutputStream.putNextEntry(): you can begin writing data to the new entry with write().
Before using java.util.zip.ZipOutputStream.write(): a ZipEntry must be created with putNextEntry(). After using java.util.zip.ZipOutputStream.write(): you may need to close the current ZipEntry with closeEntry() before starting a new one.
Q: Based on the API knowledge above, is there a logical order when using java.util.zip.ZipOutputStream.putNextEntry() and java.util.zip.ZipOutputStream.write()?",A: No
"API Knowledge:
java.sql.Connection.prepareStatement() is used to create a SQL statement, precompiled and stored in a PreparedStatement object. This object can then be used to efficiently execute this statement multiple times.
java.sql.Connection.commit() is used to make all changes made since the previous commit/rollback permanent and release any database locks currently held by the connection.
Before using java.sql.Connection.prepareStatement(): ensure that the connection is established and the SQL statement is correctly formulated. After using java.sql.Connection.prepareStatement(): you can execute the PreparedStatement as many times as needed.
Before using java.sql.Connection.commit(): ensure that you have completed your database transactions and are ready to commit them to the database. After using java.sql.Connection.commit(): all changes made during the transaction are permanent, and the transaction is considered complete.
Q: Based on the API knowledge above, is there a logical order when using java.sql.Connection.prepareStatement() and java.sql.Connection.commit()?",A: Yes
