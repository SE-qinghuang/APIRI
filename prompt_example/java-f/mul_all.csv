java.util.Date is used to represent a specific point in time, typically to store and manipulate dates and times.
java.lang.String is used to represent a sequence of characters.
java.util.Date stores the date and time information as the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT. However, java.util.Date is considered to be a legacy class and has been largely replaced by the java.time package introduced in Java 8.
java.lang.String provides various methods for manipulating and accessing strings, such as concatenation, substring extraction, and searching. String objects are stored in the string pool, which allows for efficient memory usage and string interning.
java.util.Date is a mutable class and not thread-safe. It has been largely replaced by the java.time package introduced in Java 8, which provides better performance and functionality for date and time operations.
java.lang.String is immutable, meaning it cannot be changed once created. This makes it thread-safe and allows for efficient sharing of string literals. However, concatenating strings can be slow due to the creation of new string objects.
