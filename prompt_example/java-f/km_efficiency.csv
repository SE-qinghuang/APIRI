Q: What is the performance of java.util.Hashset?,A: java.util.Hashset has fast search and insertion times due to its hashing algorithm; It is thread-safe and can be used in a multithreaded environment. It does not allow duplicate elements and does not maintain the order of the elements.
Q: What is the performance of java.util.Treeset?,"A: java.util.Treeset is a sorted set, the elements are stored in a sorted order. It allows for efficient search and insertion of elements. It may not be as fast as other set implementations; It does not allow for null elements; It is not thread-safe."
Q: What is the performance of java.lang.StringBuffer?,A: java.lang.StringBuffer is mutable; it can efficiently insert and delete characters from the buffer; StringBuffer is thread-safe; StringBuffer has a larger capacity than String. StringBuffer is slow; cannot change the capacity.
Q: What is the performance of java.io.FileWriter?,A: java.io.FileWriter allows for easy writing to a file; it can specify the file path and choose to append or overwrite the existing content. it cannot handle complex data structures like objects or arrays; it can not handle large files efficiently.
