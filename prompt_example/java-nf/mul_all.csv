javax.sql.DataSource.getConnection() is used to obtain a connection to the database.
java.sql.DriverManager.getConnection() is used to establish a connection to the database using a database URL.
javax.sql.DataSource.getConnection() provides an abstraction over database connections and can be managed in a container (such as a Java EE server), allowing for easier connection pooling and management.

The available scenarios of java.sql.DriverManager.getConnection(): Need to establish a direct connection to a database without the need for a managed environment or when working with standalone applications.
The unavailable scenarios of javax.sql.DataSource.getConnection(): Need to connect to a database in environments where connection pooling and managed connections are not beneficial or possible.
Before using javax.sql.DataSource.getConnection(): Configure a DataSource either in the application server or programmatically. After using javax.sql.DataSource.getConnection(): Close the connection to return it to the pool and release resources.

The unavailable scenarios for javax.naming.InitialContext.lookup(): need to perform complex queries within a directory service or when the required resource is not registered in the JNDI environment.
Before using javax.naming.InitialContext.lookup(): Ensure that the resource you are trying to access is properly registered in the JNDI environment of your application server. After using javax.naming.InitialContext.lookup(): No specific cleanup is typically required, but understanding the lifecycle of retrieved resources is important for proper resource management.
Before using javax.nanning.directory.DirContext.search(): Configure the directory context and establish a connection to the directory service. After using javax.naming.directory.DirContext.search(): Close the directory context to release any resources held by the directory service connection.
javax.naming.InitialContext.lookup() can accomplish the following tasks: 1) Resource lookup; 2) Service location; 3) Environment naming context access; 4) EJB reference retrieval; 5) JNDI context manipulation.
javax.naming.directory.DirContext.search() can accomplish the following tasks: 1) Advanced directory searches; 2) Attribute-based queries; 3) LDAP integration; 4) Filtering search results; 5) Managing directory entries.
