"API Knowledge:
javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilder.parse() is used to parse XML documents and return a DOM object.
javax.xml.xpath.XPath.evaluate() is used to evaluate XPath expressions against an XML document and return the result.
javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilder.parse() is designed for reading and parsing XML documents into a DOM tree structure; it is not optimized for searching or querying XML documents.
javax.xml.xpath.XPath.evaluate() is optimized for searching and querying XML documents using XPath expressions; it does not create a DOM tree structure.
Claim: Based on the API Knowledge above, javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilder.parse() and javax.xml.xpath.XPath.evaluate() have similar usage and efficiency comparison.",Answer: Correct

javax.naming.InitialContext.lookup() is used to look up objects in the JNDI naming service.
javax.mail.Transport.send() is used to send an email message.
javax.naming.InitialContext.lookup() is designed for locating objects within a directory service using JNDI; it is not related to email services.
javax.mail.Transport.send() is specifically designed for sending email messages; it does not perform lookups in directory services.
Claim: Based on the API Knowledge above, javax.naming.InitialContext.lookup() and javax.mail.Transport.send() have similar usage and efficiency comparison.",Answer: Incorrect

javax.crypto.Cipher.init() is used to initialize a Cipher object with a key and a set of algorithm parameters.
javax.crypto.Mac.init() is used to initialize a Message Authentication Code (MAC) object with a key.
javax.crypto.Cipher.init() is used for setting up cryptographic ciphers for encryption and decryption operations; it requires a key and possibly an algorithm parameter specification.
javax.crypto.Mac.init() is used for preparing MAC operations for data integrity and authentication; it requires a key but operates on a different principle than encryption/decryption.
Claim: Based on the API Knowledge above, javax.crypto.Cipher.init() and javax.crypto.Mac.init() have similar usage and efficiency comparison.",Answer: Correct
