"API Knowledge:
javax.xml.transform.sax.SAXTransformerFactory.newTransformerHandler() is used to create a new handler that can transform SAX XML events into a Result.
javax.xml.transform.dom.DOMTransformerFactory.newTransformer() is used to create a new Transformer that can transform a DOM node's XML source into a Result.
The javax.xml.transform.sax.SAXTransformerFactory.newTransformerHandler() method creates a TransformerHandler that can process SAX events and generate a transformation result.
The javax.xml.transform.dom.DOMTransformerFactory.newTransformer() method creates a Transformer that can take a DOM node as the source for transformation.
Claim: Based on the API Knowledge above, javax.xml.transform.sax.SAXTransformerFactory.newTransformerHandler() and javax.xml.transform.dom.DOMTransformerFactory.newTransformer() have similar usage but different behaviors.",Answer: Correct
"API Knowledge:
javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance() is used to create a new instance of a DocumentBuilderFactory, enabling applications to obtain a parser that produces DOM object trees from XML documents.
javax.xml.xpath.XPathFactory.newInstance() is used to create a new instance of an XPathFactory, enabling applications to compile XPath expressions and evaluate them against specified XML documents.
javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance() is a factory API that enables applications to obtain a parser that produces DOM object trees from XML documents. This method ensures an application's independence from the actual implementation of the parser.
javax.xml.xpath.XPathFactory.newInstance() is used to compile XPath expressions. This factory class provides a platform-neutral way for code to implement the XPath specification.
Claim: Based on the API Knowledge above, javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance() and javax.xml.xpath.XPathFactory.newInstance() have similar usage but different behaviors.",Answer: Incorrect
