"API Knowledge:
javax.servlet.Filter.doFilter() is used to execute a filter in the web application, which can modify the request and response objects or terminate the request-response cycle.
javax.servlet.FilterChain.doFilter() is used to invoke the next filter in the filter chain, or if the calling filter is the last filter, to invoke the target resource at the end of the chain.
Before using javax.servlet.Filter.doFilter(): ensure the request and response are in the correct state for processing; potentially modify the request or response. After using javax.servlet.Filter.doFilter(): optionally modify the request or response based on processing; decide whether to pass control to the next filter or not.
Before using javax.servlet.FilterChain.doFilter(): ensure that any preprocessing or setup required by the previous filters has been completed. After using javax.servlet.FilterChain.doFilter(): perform any post-processing on the request or response; return control to the previous filter.
Q: Based on the API knowledge above, is there a logical order when using javax.servlet.Filter.doFilter() and javax.servlet.FilterChain.doFilter()?",A: Yes
