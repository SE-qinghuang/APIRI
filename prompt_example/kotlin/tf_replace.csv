The available scenarios of kotlin.collections.listOf: need to create a list of elements that won't change.
The unavailable scenarios of kotlin.collections.mutableListOf: when you don't need to modify the list after creation. If your list is set at creation and does not require changes, using listOf would be more appropriate as it is immutable and can offer better performance and safety guarantees.
Claim: kotlin.collections.listOf() can be used in the above unavailable scenarios of kotlin.collections.mutableListOf().",Answer: Correct
"API Knowledge:
