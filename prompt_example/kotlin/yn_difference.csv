"API Knowledge:
kotlin.collections.List.get is used to retrieve an element at a specified index in a list.
kotlin.collections.List.getOrElse is used to retrieve an element at a specified index, or return a default value if the index is out of bounds.
The kotlin.collections.List.get function retrieves an element at the given index from the list. If the index is out of bounds, it throws an IndexOutOfBoundsException.
The kotlin.collections.List.getOrElse function retrieves an element at the given index or returns a default value provided by a lambda if the index is out of bounds.
Q: Based on the API Knowledge above, do kotlin.collections.List.get and kotlin.collections.List.getOrElse have similar usage but different behaviors?",A: Yes
"API Knowledge:
kotlin.text.toInt is used to convert a string to an Int.
kotlin.text.toIntOrNull is used to convert a string to an Int or return null if the string is not a valid representation of a number.
The kotlin.text.toInt function converts a string into an Int. It throws a NumberFormatException if the string is not a valid representation of a number.
The kotlin.text.toIntOrNull function converts a string into an Int or returns null if the string is not a valid representation of a number.
Q: Based on the API Knowledge above, do kotlin.text.toInt and kotlin.text.toIntOrNull have similar usage but different behaviors?",A: Yes
"API Knowledge:
kotlin.system.exitProcess() in Kotlin is used to terminate the current process and return a specified exit code to the operating system.
kotlin.collections.List.indexOf() in Kotlin is used to find the index of the first occurrence of a specified element in the list, or -1 if the element is not present.
kotlin.system.exitProcess() terminates the currently running Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The status argument serves as an exit code, where a non-zero value typically indicates abnormal termination. This function does not return to the caller, making it effective for stopping an application or a specific execution path immediately.
kotlin.collections.List.indexOf() provides a way to determine the position of an element within a list, making it useful for tasks involving search or positioning elements in collections. The search is performed in a linear fashion, starting from the beginning of the list.
Q: Based on the API Knowledge above, do kotlin.system.exitProcess() and kotlin.collections.List.indexOf() have similar usage but different behaviors?",A: No

kotlin.io.File.delete is used to delete the file or directory denoted by this abstract pathname.
kotlin.io.File.deleteRecursively is used to delete this file or directory and all its contents recursively.
The kotlin.io.File.delete function deletes the file or directory denoted by the abstract pathname. If the operation is successful, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false.
The kotlin.io.File.deleteRecursively function deletes the file or directory denoted by the abstract pathname and all its contents if it is a directory. It returns true if the deletion was successful and false otherwise.
