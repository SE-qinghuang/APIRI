Q: When should I not use kotlin.collections.listOf?,"A: The unavailable scenarios of kotlin.collections.listOf: when you need a mutable list that allows adding, removing, or updating elements. listOf returns an immutable list, so it's not suitable for cases requiring list modification."
Q: When should I not use kotlin.collections.mutableListOf?,"A: The unavailable scenarios of kotlin.collections.mutableListOf: when you don't need to modify the list after creation. If your list is set at creation and does not require changes, using listOf would be more appropriate as it is immutable and can offer better performance and safety guarantees."
Q: When should I not use kotlin.text.replace?,"A: The unavailable scenarios of kotlin.text.replace: when you need to perform replacements based on regular expressions or complex matching patterns. While replace can replace simple substrings, for more complex pattern-based replacements, you should use replace with a regular expression."
Q: When should I not use kotlin.text.replaceFirst?,"A: The unavailable scenarios of kotlin.text.replaceFirst: similar to replace, but specifically when you want to replace all occurrences of a substring or pattern rather than just the first one. For replacing all occurrences, you would use replace instead of replaceFirst."
