"API Pairs: (java.util.arraydeque, java.util.arraylist), (java.util.arraydeque, java.util.linkedlist), (java.util.arraylist, java.util.linkedlist)
API Knowledge:
1- The primary usage of java.util.ArrayDeque is to implement a double-ended queue (deque) using an array as the underlying data structure.
   The primary usage of java.util.ArrayList is to implement a resizable array-backed list, allowing dynamic addition, removal, and modification of elements.
   The primary usage of java.util.LinkedList is to implement a doubly linked list, providing efficient insertion and deletion operations at both ends of the list.
2- java.util.ArrayDeque is resizable and does not have a fixed capacity. It allows rapid insertion and deletion at both ends of the deque, providing constant time complexity for these operations.
   java.util.ArrayList internally uses an array to store elements and automatically grows its capacity as needed. It allows fast random access to elements but slower insertion and deletion at arbitrary positions.
   java.util.LinkedList maintains a sequence of elements with each element pointing to the next and previous elements in the list. It allows rapid insertion and removal at both ends but slower random access.
3- Use java.util.ArrayDeque when you need a deque implementation with efficient insertion and removal operations at both ends, and you don't require thread-safety. Avoid using java.util.ArrayDeque when you need thread-safety or when you require efficient random access to elements within the deque.
   Use java.util.ArrayList when you need a dynamic list implementation that provides fast random access to elements and you frequently add or remove elements at the end of the list. Avoid using java.util.ArrayList when you require efficient insertion or deletion of elements at arbitrary positions within the list or when thread-safety is necessary.
   Use java.util.LinkedList when you need efficient insertion and removal operations at both ends of the list, or when you frequently modify the list structure. Avoid using java.util.LinkedList when you require fast random access to elements or when memory efficiency is crucial, as each element in the list incurs additional memory overhead for storing references.
4- java.util.ArrayDeque provides constant time performance for adding and removing elements from both ends of the deque, making it suitable for use in scenarios requiring high-performance deque operations.
   java.util.ArrayList provides constant time complexity for random access operations (get and set), but linear time complexity for insertion and deletion operations at arbitrary positions, making it less suitable for large-scale modifications.
   java.util.LinkedList provides constant time complexity for insertion and deletion operations at both ends of the list but linear time complexity for random access operations, making it less suitable for scenarios requiring frequent random access.
5- Before using java.util.ArrayDeque, ensure you have initialized the deque instance. After using it, consider checking the size or contents of the deque, performing any necessary cleanup, or handling exceptions.
   Before using java.util.ArrayList, ensure you have instantiated the list object. After using it, consider checking the size or contents of the list, performing any necessary cleanup, or handling exceptions.
   Before using java.util.LinkedList, ensure you have created an instance of the linked list. After using it, consider checking the size or contents of the list, performing any necessary cleanup, or handling exceptions.
6- java.util.ArrayDeque can efficiently perform tasks such as implementing a deque, managing a collection of elements with efficient insertion and removal at both ends, and providing fast access to the first and last elements.
   java.util.ArrayList can efficiently manage a dynamic collection of elements, supporting tasks such as adding, removing, and modifying elements, as well as providing fast access to elements by index.
   java.util.LinkedList can efficiently manage a sequence of elements, supporting tasks such as adding, removing, and modifying elements at both ends of the list, as well as traversing the list forwards and backwards.

   java.util.Vector is a synchronized resizable array that can dynamically grow or shrink. It allows random access to elements by index and supports operations like add, remove, and iterate.
3- You should use java.util.Stack when you require a LIFO data structure, especially in scenarios like parsing (e.g., parsing expressions), backtracking algorithms, and undo mechanisms. You should avoid using java.util.Stack when you need a more specialized data structure, such as a deque with additional functionality, or when concurrency is a concern, as Stack is synchronized, which can impact performance.
   You should use java.util.Vector when you need a dynamically resizable array that is thread-safe and supports random access to elements, especially in scenarios where concurrency is a concern. You should avoid using java.util.Vector when you don't require synchronization overhead or when more efficient alternatives like ArrayList suffice, especially in single-threaded applications.
4- The performance of java.util.Stack operations like push, pop, and peek is generally efficient, but due to its synchronization, concurrent access can introduce overhead.
