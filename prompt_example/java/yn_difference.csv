java.util.HashMap is used to store and manage key-value pairs.
java.util.Hashtable is used to store and retrieve data in a key-value pair format.
The java.util.HashMap provides constant time performance for the basic operations such as get and put. It allows null values and the null key. It is not thread-safe and must be synchronized externally if used in a multi-threaded environment.
