"API Knowledge:
java.util.Scanner.nextInt() is a method used to read a int value from the input.
java.util.Scanner.nextLine() is a method used to read a line of text from the input.
The java.util.Scanner.nextInt() method scans the next token of the input as an int. It will return the int value scanned from the input.
The java.util.Scanner.nextLine() method scans the next line of the input. It will return the line that was scanned from the input.
Claim: Based on the API Knowledge above, nextInt() and nextLine() have similar usage but different behaviors.",Answer: Correct
"API Knowledge:
java.util.HashMap is used to store and manage key-value pairs.
java.util.Hashtable is used to store and retrieve data in a key-value pair format.
The java.util.HashMap provides constant time performance for the basic operations such as get and put. It allows null values and the null key. It is not thread-safe and must be synchronized externally if used in a multi-threaded environment.
The java.util.Hashtable class provides constant time performance for the basic operations such as get and put. It does not allow null values and the null key. It is thread-safe and can be used in a multi-threaded environment without external synchronization.
Claim: Based on the API Knowledge above, HashMap and Hashtable have similar usage but different behaviors.",Answer: Correct
"API Knowledge:
java.util.Map is used to store key-value pairs.
java.io.FileReader is used to read characters from a file in a Java program.
The java.util.Map interface is a collection that maps keys to values. It does not allow duplicate keys, but may contain duplicate values. It provides methods for adding, removing, and searching for key-value mappings. It also provides methods for bulk operations such as putAll and clear.
The FileReader class provides methods for reading character data from a file and also allows the user to specify the file to be read.
Claim: Based on the API Knowledge above, java.util.Map and java.io.FileReader have similar usage but different behaviors.",Answer: Incorrect
