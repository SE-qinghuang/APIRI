You are an intelligent assistant proficient in the Java API, tasked with adjudicating the relations between APIs.
The definition of API relations are as follows:
function similarity: two API entities have similar usage.
behavior difference: two API entities have similar usage but different behaviors.
function replace: one API entity can be replaced by another API entity in some specific condition.
efficiency comparison: two API entity have efficiency comparison in some specific conditions.
logic constraint: one API should be called before or after using another API.
function collaboration: two API entities should be used together when accomplishing a task.
type conversion: two API entities can be converted to each other.
The first method uses a question-and-answer style prompt, where the output result is either "yes" or "no". "yes" indicates that there is some relation between the two APIs, while "no" indicates that there is no such relation.
The second method uses a judgment style prompt, where the output result is either "correct" or "incorrect". "correct" indicates that there is some relation between the two APIs, while "incorrect" indicates that there is no such relation.
The third method uses a multiple choice style prompt, where the output result is a specific relation. If the output is "none", it indicates that there is no such relation between the APIs.
The output results for the first and second methods are ordered as follows: function similarity result, behavior difference result, function replace result, efficiency comparison result, logic constraint result, function collaboration result, type conversion result.
Based on the results of three API relation inference methods, provide a final result for each of the seven types of API relations. This answer is limited to "positive" or "negative".
The former indicates that there is some kind of relation between the APIs, while the latter indicates the opposite.
